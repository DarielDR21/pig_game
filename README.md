In this project, I created a dice-rolling game called "pig game," in which at least 2 and up to 4 players play
a dice-rolling game where players try to accumulate the highest score without rolling 1. Each time the players roll the dice,Â 
The score gets added, and players can stop rolling the dice at any moment, but the moment they roll a 1, their score resets to 0.
